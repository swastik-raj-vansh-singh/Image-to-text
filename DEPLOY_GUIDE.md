# Image to Text Converter - Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through deploying the Image to Text Converter application to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account (recommended)
- Vercel account (free tier available)
- Node.js installed on your local machine (if deploying from local)

## Option 1: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

### Step 1: Fork or Push to GitHub
1. If you don't have the code in a GitHub repository, create one and push your code
2. Make sure your repository includes all the necessary files:
   - `package.json` with all dependencies
   - `next.config.js`
   - `tsconfig.json` 
   - `vercel.json` (optional but recommended)

### Step 2: Connect with Vercel
1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
2. Sign up or log in (you can use your GitHub account for easier integration)
3. Click on "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
4. Select the GitHub repository containing your Image to Text Converter code
5. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project

### Step 3: Configure the Project
1. Configure your project:
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js (should be auto-detected)
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (default)
   - **Output Directory**: `.next` (default)
   - **Install Command**: `npm install` (default)
2. Under "Environment Variables", add any needed variables (if applicable)
3. Click "Deploy"

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment
Vercel will build and deploy your application. This process usually takes 1-2 minutes.

### Step 5: Access Your Deployed App
Once deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a URL (e.g., `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`). Click on the URL to view your live application.

## Option 2: Deploy Using Vercel CLI

### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### Step 2: Login to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```

### Step 3: Deploy
Navigate to your project directory and run:
```bash
vercel
```

Follow the interactive prompts, and your project will be deployed.

### Step 4: Deploy to Production
When ready to deploy to production:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Option 3: Use the Deployment Scripts

We've included convenient deployment scripts:

### For Windows:
1. Open PowerShell
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. Run:
```powershell
.\deploy.ps1
```

### For macOS/Linux:
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
```
4. Run the script:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
If you encounter build errors during deployment:
1. Check the Vercel build logs
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in `package.json`
3. Verify that your code compiles locally with `npm run build`
4. Check for TypeScript errors with `npm run lint`

### Runtime Errors
If your application deploys but doesn't function correctly:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Ensure environment variables are properly set
3. Verify that API endpoints and external services are accessible from Vercel

### Performance Issues
If your application is slow:
1. Enable Vercel's performance analytics
2. Consider adding caching headers for static assets
3. Implement image optimization if handling many images

## Continuous Deployment

Vercel automatically sets up continuous deployment from your GitHub repository:
- Each push to the main branch will trigger a production deployment
- Each pull request will generate a preview deployment

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues during deployment, you can:
1. Check the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs)
2. Contact the developers of this application
